# Kconfiglib #

A Python library for doing stuff with [Kconfig](https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/kbuild/kconfig-language.txt)-based
configuration systems. Can extract information, query and set symbol values,
and read and write <i>.config</i> files. Highly compatible with the
<i>scripts/kconfig/\*conf</i> utilities in the kernel, usually invoked via make
targets such as <i>menuconfig</i> and <i>defconfig</i>.

Supports both Python 2 and Python 3 without modification.

One feature is missing: Kconfiglib assumes the modules symbol is `MODULES`, and
will warn if `option modules` is set on some other symbol. Let me know if this
is a problem for you, as adding support shouldn't be that hard. I haven't seen
modules used outside the kernel, where the name is unlikely to change.

## Installation ##

### Installation instructions for the Linux kernel ###

Run the following commands in the kernel root:

    $ git clone git://github.com/ulfalizer/Kconfiglib.git  
    $ git am Kconfiglib/makefile.patch

<i>(Note: The directory name Kconfiglib/ is significant.)</i>

In addition to creating a handy interface, the make targets created by the
patch (`scriptconfig` and `iscriptconfig`) are needed to pick up environment
variables set in the kernel makefiles and later referenced in the Kconfig files
(<i>ARCH</i>, <i>SRCARCH</i>, and <i>KERNELVERSION</i> as of Linux v4.0-rc3).
The documentation explains how the make targets are used. The compatibility
tests in the test suite also needs them.

Please tell me if the patch does not apply. It should be trivial to apply
manually, as it's just a block of text that needs to be inserted near the other
<i>*conf:</i> targets.

### Installation instructions for other projects ###

The entire library is contained in [kconfiglib.py](kconfiglib.py). Drop it
somewhere and read the documentation. Make sure Kconfiglib sees environment
variables referenced in the configuration.

## Documentation ##

The (extensive) documentation is generated by running

    $ pydoc kconfiglib

in the <i>Kconfiglib/</i> directory. For HTML output,
use

    $ pydoc -w kconfiglib
    
You could also browse the docstrings directly in [kconfiglib.py](kconfiglib.py).

Please tell me if something is unclear to you or can be explained better. The Kconfig
language has some dark corners.

## Examples ##

 * The [examples/](examples/) directory contains simple example scripts. See the documentation for how to run them.

 * [gen-manual-lists.py](http://git.buildroot.net/buildroot/tree/support/scripts/gen-manual-lists.py) from [Buildroot](http://buildroot.uclibc.org/) generates listings for the [appendix of the manual](http://buildroot.uclibc.org/downloads/manual/manual.html#_appendix).

 * [genboardscfg.py](http://git.denx.de/?p=u-boot.git;a=blob;f=tools/genboardscfg.py;hb=HEAD) from [Das U-Boot](http://www.denx.de/wiki/U-Boot) generates some sort of legacy board database by pulling information from a newly added Kconfig-based configuration system (as far as I understand it :).

 * [SConf](https://github.com/CoryXie/SConf) builds an interactive configuration interface (like *menuconfig*, etc.) on top of Kconfiglib, for use e.g. with SCons.

 * [kconfig-diff.py](https://gist.github.com/dubiousjim/5638961) -- a script by [dubiousjim](https://github.com/dubiousjim) that compares kernel configurations.

 * Originally, Kconfiglib was used in chapter 4 of my [master's thesis](http://liu.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:473038/FULLTEXT01.pdf) to automatically generate a "minimal" kernel for a given system. Parts of it bother me a bit now, but that's how it goes with old work.

## Thanks ##

Thanks to [Philip Craig](https://github.com/philipc) for adding
support for the `allnoconfig_y` option and fixing an obscure issue
with `comment`s inside `choice`s (that didn't affect correctness but
made outputs differ). `allnoconfig_y` is used to force certain symbols
to `y` during `make allnoconfig` to improve coverage.
